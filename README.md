This class will check IPv4 address with http:BL service to determine if it's blacklisted.

See `example.php` for usage example.

Note that error code 1 means that IP address is not listed on http:BL database. It can also mean that your http:BL API key is incorrect. Make sure you have a valid http:BL API key and service is not currently offline.
