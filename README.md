Cached http:BL is a PHP5 library that allows to check IPv4 address with `Project HoneyPot's http:BL service` to determine if it's located on the blacklist.

Why use http:BL service?
------------------------

Http:BL provides data back about the IP addresses of visitors to your website. Data is exchanged over the DNS system. You may query your local DNS server and receive a response back that indicates the type of visitor to your site, how threatening that visitor is, and how long it has been since the visitor has last been seen within the Project Honey Pot trap network.

Why use Cached http:BL library?
-------------------------------

One of the main advantages of using CachedHttpBL library is possibility to cache http:BL responses by using cache providers. You can prepare new cache provider by implementing dedicated cache interface. Library is written in elegant objective style allowing you to extend his functionality.

Try it!
-------

Stable version:

```bash
$ php composer.phar require clash82/cachedhttpbl:2.*
```

Here is an example of how to use library with CSV cache adapter:

```php
// suspicious IP address
$ip = '';

// valid http:BL API key (you can create one at http:BL dashboard)
// please, keep it mind that there's no way to validate this key, so make
// sure you have entered a valid key
$httpbl_api_key = '';

// we are using namespace autoloader
require_once '../vendor/autoload.php';

// setup a new storage adapter
$adapter = new CachedHttpBL\CacheAdapter\CSV(sys_get_temp_dir().'cache.tmp');

// setup library class
$cachedHttpBl = new CachedHttpBL\Client($httpbl_api_key, $adapter);

try {

    // fetch response data from http:BL service
    $response = $cachedHttpBl->checkIP($ip);

    // we'll use an additional translator to output more details about response (useful, but not required)
    $translator = new CachedHttpBL\Translator\ProjectHoneyPot();
    $translator->translate($response);

    echo sprintf('The http:BL service was requested to get details about <b>%s</b> IP address:<br /><br />', $ip);

    echo sprintf('Type code: <strong>%d</strong><br />',
        $response->getType());

    echo sprintf('Activity code: <strong>%d</strong> (<i>%s</i>)<br />',
        $response->getActivity(),
        $translator->getActivityDescription());

    echo sprintf('Threat code: <strong>%d</strong> (<i>%s</i>)<br />',
        $response->getThreat(),
        $translator->getThreatDescription());

    echo sprintf('Type meaning code: <strong>%d</strong> (<i>%s</i>)<br />',
        $response->getTypeMeaning(),
        $translator->getTypeMeaningDescription());

    // write cache for further usage
    $adapter->writeCache();

} catch (\Exception $e) {

    echo sprintf('<br />Houston, we have a problem:<br /><b>%s</b>', $e->getMessage());

}
```
